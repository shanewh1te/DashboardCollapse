# DashboardCollapse

If you are like me you might be finding it difficult to manage large or even small amounts of dashboard widgets on one page, difficulty dragging them around for example!

DashboardCollapse.js just needs to be pasted into custom.js and will work straight away (However I would recommend using the script loader and making it run on pages containing '/Page/', this way it will only target dashboard pages!)
